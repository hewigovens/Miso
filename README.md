## Installation

### Requirements

- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later.
- No additional permissions are required for the core functionality.

### Download

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hewigovens/Miso/releases) page.
2. Unzip the downloaded file and drag `MISO.app` to your Applications folder.
3. Launch MISO, and it will appear in your menu bar.

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hewigovens/miso.git
cd miso
open Miso.xcodeproj
```

Build and run in Xcode 16.0 or later.

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Launch MISO** - Look for the üåê icon in your menu bar.
2. **Configure Methods** - Click the menu bar icon, then select "Preferences..." to set up your input methods.
3. **Use Overlay** - Click "Show/Hide Overlay" to toggle the floating HUD.

### Overlay Controls

- **Click an input method** to switch immediately.
- **Drag the overlay** to reposition it anywhere on the screen.
- The position is automatically saved.

### Configuration

Open **Preferences** to:
- **Refresh from system** to detect new input methods.
- **Open Input Sources Settings** to configure system input methods.
- **Toggle launch at login** (requires macOS 13+).

## How It Works

MISO uses macOS's built-in **Text Input Source APIs**, which require no special permissions:

- `TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource()`: Detects the current input method.
- `TISSelectInputSource()`: Switches between input methods.
- `TISCreateInputSourceList()`: Discovers available methods.

This makes MISO a **zero-permission** utility that works immediately after installation.

## Architecture

MISO is built with modern Swift patterns:

- **MVVM Architecture**: For a clean separation of concerns.
- **Protocol-Oriented Design**: To ensure testable and maintainable code.
- **SwiftUI + AppKit Hybrid**: Combining the best of both frameworks.
- **Reactive UI**: For real-time updates with Combine.
