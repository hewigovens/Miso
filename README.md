## Installation

### Requirements

- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later
- No additional permissions required for core functionality

### Download

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Unzip and drag MISO.app to your Applications folder
3. Launch MISO - it will appear in your menu bar

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/miso.git
cd miso
open Miso.xcodeproj
```

Build and run in Xcode 14.0 or later.

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Launch MISO** - Look for the 🌐 icon in your menu bar
2. **Configure Methods** - Click the menu bar icon → "Preferences..." to set up input methods
3. **Use Overlay** - Click "Show/Hide Overlay" to toggle the floating HUD

### Overlay Controls

- **Click overlay** to expand/collapse
- **Click input method** to switch immediately  
- **Drag overlay** to reposition anywhere on screen
- Position is automatically saved

### Configuration

Open Preferences to:
- **Add/remove input methods** from the overlay
- **Refresh from system** to detect new input methods
- **Open Input Sources Settings** to configure system input methods
- **Toggle launch at login** (macOS 13+)

## How It Works

MISO uses macOS's built-in Text Input Source APIs, which require no special permissions:

- `TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource()` - Detect current input method
- `TISSelectInputSource()` - Switch between input methods
- `TISCreateInputSourceList()` - Discover available methods

This makes MISO a **zero-permission** utility that works immediately after installation.

## Architecture

Built with modern Swift patterns:

- **MVVM Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Protocol-Oriented Design** - Testable and maintainable code
- **SwiftUI + AppKit Hybrid** - Best of both frameworks
- **Reactive UI** - Real-time updates with Combine

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed technical documentation.

- [ ] Custom flag/icon support
- [ ] Multi-monitor support enhancements

## FAQ

**Q: Why does MISO need Input Monitoring permission?**
A: It doesn't! Input Monitoring is only shown for potential future keyboard shortcut features. Core functionality works without any permissions.

**Q: How is this different from other input switchers?**
A: MISO requires zero permissions and works immediately. Most other tools require accessibility permissions which can be complex to set up.

**Q: Can I hide MISO from the dock?**
A: Yes! MISO runs as a menu bar utility by default and doesn't appear in the dock.

**Q: Does MISO work with all input methods?**
A: MISO works with any input method that appears in System Preferences → Input Sources, using the same APIs as the system switcher.
